[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Conduct a Vulnerability Check Using OpenVAS

## 1.1 Start and Set the Services
<ol>
<li>On the Kali machine to access the graphical login screen</li>
<li>Log in kali machine with username and password</li>
<li>Open a Terminal window by clicking on the Terminal icon, located in the left menu pane</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Enter command below to verify docker images metasploitable 2 and OpenVAS needed exists</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Next, we can start and setup metasploitable. In the Terminal, type the following 
command to start the metasploit2. This will redirect all incoming traffic to the kali machine. 
Once executed, there will be a long string of numbers and letters, this is the container-id.</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Now we can use the container-id to check the mapped ports between the kali machine and the 
container. Type the command below to check all mapped ports. Note we only used the first 4 
characters/numbers from the container-id a0da. All of the mapped ports are within the range of 49153-49172.</li>

<br>
<li>Now metasploitable2 running, click the browser icon to start the browser.</li>
<li>In the browser window address bar, type the address of http://localhost:49168. Press Enter and metasploitable2 will open.</li>
