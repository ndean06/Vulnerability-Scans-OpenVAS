[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Conduct a Vulnerability Check Using OpenVAS

## 1.1 Start and Set the Services
<ol>
<li>On the Kali machine to access the graphical login screen</li>
<li>Log in kali machine with username and password</li>
<li>Open a Terminal window by clicking on the Terminal icon, located in the left menu pane</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Enter command below to verify docker images metasploitable 2 and OpenVAS needed exists</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Next, we can start and setup metasploitable.<br> In the Terminal, type the following 
command to start the metasploit2.<br>This will redirect all incoming traffic to the kali machine.<br> 
Once executed, there will be a long string of numbers and letters, this is the container-id.</li>
<br>

<br>

<li>Now we can use the container-id to check the mapped ports between the kali machine and the 
container.<br>Type the command below to check all mapped ports.<br>Note: we only used the first 4 
characters/numbers from the container-id a0da.<br>All of the mapped ports are within the range of 49153-49172.</li>
<br>

<br>
<li>Now metasploitable2 running, click the browser icon to start the browser.</li>
<li>In the browser window address bar, type the address of http://localhost:49168. Press Enter and metasploitable2 will open.</li>

<br>
<li>On the page we just pulled up, we will check the database status of the DVWA machine.<br> First, click on the DVWA link. Wait for the following screen to shows up, type <strong>admin</strong> as the username and password as the password.<br>Then, click the Login button to log in. When prompted to save the password, click Never.</li>
